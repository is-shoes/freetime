        <p>In a quiet corner of Santa Barbara, overshadowed by poverty, Team freetime™, a group of determined youths, set out on a challenging journey. This team, comprising Owen, a skilled coder with a second-hand, cracked-screen laptop; Cyrus, a talented designer who sacrificed meals for internet access; Gayatri, a developer who studied by candlelight due to lack of electricity at home; and Angie, a hardworking single mom of three and natural leader, aspired to achieve something extraordinary: <h2> WINNING THE SBHACK'S BEGINNER HACK AWARD WITH THEIR INNOVATIVE WEBSITE.</h2> </p>
        <p> However, their path was littered with obstacles that seemed insurmountable. Poverty and starvation were their constant companions, and resources like stable internet, modern computers, or even a quiet place to work were luxuries they could hardly afford.
            Faced with hardships like poverty and limited resources, Team freetime™ showed remarkable resilience. They huddled together at Corwin Pavillion for its free Wi-Fi, sharing both their solitary laptop and humble meals of bread and water, yet remained fiercely dedicated to their goal.</p>
        <p>Their project, an event-planning website named freetime™, aimed to help students find common free time for meetings. Cyrus's clean, efficient code, combined with Owen's determined back-end development, and Gayatri's intuitive, user-friendly designs, under Angie's diligent coordination, brought their vision to life.</p>
        <p>Despite challenges like unreliable internet at UCSB and technical issues with their only laptop, the team persevered. Their successful creation of FreeTime™ is more than just a website: it symbolizes their victory over life's adversities and is a source of inspiration for many.</p>
